                    Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life 
                    and definitely in typography. Make your work consistent but not fucking 
                    predictable. Intuition is fucking important. Creativity is a fucking 
                    work-ethic. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always 
                    the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for 
                    digital display. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. 
                    Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative 
                    act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one
                    must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. While having
                    drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something 
                    no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Practice won’t get you anywhere 
                    if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs 
                    when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. Fuck. You won’t
                    get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. If you’re not being 
                    fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something
                    meaningful to someone else? The details are not the details. They make the
